# Java Script

I am learning javaScript recently and so here is a basic form of that.

Most of the tools in a programmers toolkit is CLI: github, shell, programming language repls etc. are all CLIs. In strictest terms, if you are interacting with a program via command line (that black thing with text on it which hackers use in movies) then it's a CLI (Command Line INTERFACE).
Think of it as texting with a program instead of you know the usual clicking of buttons.


### Multiple commands
If you have commands that need to run in order, then using a double ampersand - && - in between those commands will make it so that the preceding command must finish before the next can start.
