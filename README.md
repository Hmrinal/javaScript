# Java Script

I am learning javaScript recently and so here is a basic form of that.

Most of the tools in a programmers toolkit is CLI: github, shell, programming language repls etc. are all CLIs. In strictest terms, if you are interacting with a program via command line (that black thing with text on it which hackers use in movies) then it's a `CLI(Command Line Interface)`.

Think of it as texting with a program, instead of as we all know the usual clicking of buttons.

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the `ECMAScript` specification. JavaScript is high-level, often `just-in-time` compiled, and multi-paradigm.

- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
- JavaScript is easy to learn.
- JavaScript Can Change HTML Content


### Multiple Commands

Here we have two js files here which are `index.js` and `quiz.js`. We have to use multiple command to run both of them together.
If you have commands that need to run in order, then using a double ampersand  &&  in between those commands will make it so that the preceding command must finish before the next can start.

Make changes in `packages.json`
