# Java Script

I am learning javaScript recently and so here is a basic form of that.

Most of the tools in a programmers toolkit is CLI: github, shell, programming language repls etc. are all CLIs. In strictest terms, if you are interacting with a program via command line (that black thing with text on it which hackers use in movies) then it's a `CLI(Command Line Interface)`.

Think of it as texting with a program, instead of as we all know the usual clicking of buttons.

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a dynamic computer programming language that conforms to the `ECMAScript` specification. JavaScript is high-level, often `just-in-time` compiled, and multi-paradigm.

It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
- JavaScript is easy to learn.
- JavaScript Can Change HTML Content

### Specifications 

- JS is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
- Designed for creating network-centric applications.
- Complementary to and integrated with Java.
- Complemantary to and integrated with HTML.
- Open and cross-platform.

### Why we use JS? 

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.   
Where `HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style` to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages `interactive elements` that engage a user.


### Multiple Commands

Here we have two js files here which are `index.js` and `quiz.js`. We have to use multiple command to run both of them together.
If you have commands that need to run in order, then using a double ampersand  &&  in between those commands will make it so that the preceding command must finish before the next can start.

Make changes in `packages.json`

### Advantages of JavaScript:

- Less server interaction- You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
- Immediate feedback to the visitors- They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
- Increased interactivity- You can create `interfaces that react` when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

### Limitations of JavaScript:

- Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
- JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.
- JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.
