# Java Script

I am learning javaScript recently and so here is a basic form of that.

Most of the tools in a programmers toolkit is CLI: github, shell, programming language repls etc. are all CLIs. In strictest terms, if you are interacting with a program via command line (that black thing with text on it which hackers use in movies) then it's a CLI (Command Line INTERFACE).

Think of it as texting with a program, instead of as we all know the usual clicking of buttons.

### Multiple Commands

Here we have two js files here which are ```index.js``` and ```quiz.js```. We have to use multiple command to run both of them together.
If you have commands that need to run in order, then using a double ampersand - && - in between those commands will make it so that the preceding command must finish before the next can start.

Make changes in ```packages.json```
